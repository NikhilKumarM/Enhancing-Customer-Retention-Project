# Enhancing-Customer-Retention-Project

The idea of the project is to identify the top N customers of the product who are going to be loyal to the company upon offering the discount on the product.
The previous transaction details of the customers are available and from that after preprocessing the data, it is used to predict the loyal customers after providing the discount.
Logistic regression machine learning algorithm is used. So, we get the probability of customers returning to purchase the product from, which we can identify the top N loyal custmoers.
Adopted Service Oriented Architecture to create this service. Node.js, mongoDB and Apache hadoop are the other technologies used in this project.
